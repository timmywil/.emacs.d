TabBarMode
==========

This is a fork of the [Aquamacs](https://aquamacs.org/)
[TabBarMode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabBarMode) implementation which is
an up-to date version of this minor mode. TabBarMode is perfectly portable
between different Emacs implementations and this repository is intended to
provide just that.

Since the repository is a filtered clone of the Aquamacs Git repo and hence it
should be perfectly possible to track changes made upstream.
